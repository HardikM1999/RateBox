# RateBox
RateBox takes ratings from Omdb api and combines the ratings of Imdb, Rotten Tomatoes, MetaCritic.
It uses Fetch Api and bootstrap for ui.
#To be Done
Rotten tomatoes api can be added and we can update the algorithm to give combined rating based on amount of reviews since more weight should be given if more people/critics have rated the movie.
